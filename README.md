# GLAB-370.1.2-The-Great-If-Else-Adventure

## Introduction
Welcome to the GLAB-370.1.2! In this lab, you will embark on an exciting adventure into the world of if-else statements in Python. Get ready to unravel the mysteries of decision-making as you explore the depths of conditional logic. But don't worry, we'll make it fun along the way!

## Prerequisites
To fully enjoy this lab, you should have a basic understanding of Python syntax

## Instructions

### Step 1: Enter the Land of If-Else
As you step into this peculiar land, you'll encounter an if-else statement like no other. Brace yourself and prepare to be amazed. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```
# The Enchanted Door
password = input("Enter the secret password: ")

if password == "Open Sesame":
    print("The door opens wide. Welcome!")
else:
    print("The door remains closed. Access denied!")
```

### Step 2: Run the Magical Code
To witness the power of this mystical if-else statement, follow these steps:

- Open your favorite Python IDE or a text editor.
- Create a new Python file and save it with a whimsical name like "if_else_adventure.py".
- Copy the code snippet from Step 1 into your file.
- Save the file and run it.

### Step 3: Take a Leap of Faith

Now it's your turn to dive into the enchanting realm of if-else statements. Unleash your creativity and write your own code snippets using if-else statements. Need some inspiration? Here are a few ideas to get you started:

- [ ] **The Potion Conundrum:** Write a program that asks the user for their age. If they are under 18, display a message saying they can't drink the magic potion. Otherwise, grant them access to the secret potion recipe.

- [ ] **The Riddle of the Sphinx:** Create a riddle game where the user has to guess the correct answer. If they guess right, congratulate them on their wisdom. Otherwise, bewilder them with a clever hint.

- [ ] **The Tricky Troll:** Imagine a troll guarding a bridge. Prompt the user to answer a riddle. If they answer correctly, they may pass unharmed. Otherwise, well... let's just say they'll have a bumpy journey.

Remember, the sky's the limit! Feel free to come up with your own if-else adventures. Get creative, be playful, and have fun!

### Step 4: Share Your Quest
Once you've completed your if-else adventures, share your magical creations with your instructor.


## Conclusion
Congratulations on completing **The Great If-Else Adventure**! You've mastered the art of decision-making through if-else statements and discovered the fun side of programming. Take these newfound skills and continue your journey into the vast realms of Python programming. The magical world awaits your exploration!
